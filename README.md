I enjoyed this article: [AI vs Gen Z: How AI has changed the career pathway for junior developers](https://stackoverflow.blog/2025/09/10/ai-vs-gen-z/)


# Reflections
When I first decided to major in CS, there was an unspoken guarantee: study hard, learn coding, do internships, and youll have a stable life post-grad. The article points out that AI is already replacing and reshaping entry-level roles. When I was a sophomore, ChatGPT was just starting to blow up, and I didn’t think much of it at the time. But looking back now, it’s a crazy to see how much it’s evolved in such a short period. I think this article directly reflects what the majority of CS majors are experiencing today. I find this article quite relatable because it direcly addresses the uncertainty that CS majors are facing in todays job market. It makes me realize that the path that I thought would be pretty straight forward is changing faster than anticipated. Its a fun article to catch up on, also because it sparks a lot of ideas about what the CS job market will look like once it fully adapts to the AI we have today. It's interesting to think about how roles might shift or even dissapear entirely, and what new positions could be created in its place. It really gets me thinking about how quickly things could change and what skills would be most valuable moving forward.

I really liked your reflection on how AI is reshaping the CS job market.  
I agree that things are changing fast, and it’s natural to feel uncertain.  
But I also think we don’t need to worry too much right now.  

As the article I read points out, AI is good at generating code,  
but it still struggles with understanding and clarifying requirements.  
That means there is still a huge need for human creativity,  
communication, and problem-solving skills in software development.  

So while AI will definitely change our field, there will still be  
many opportunities for us — especially if we focus on the skills  
that AI can’t easily replace.
